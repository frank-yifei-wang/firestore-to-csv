# Firestore2CSV

This program demonstrates how to extract Firestore data into a CSV file using the so-called paginated algorithm (can prevent 503 timeout error for large dataset). Simply open `firestore2csv_demo.py` to read the source code.

[Another repo of mine](https://github.com/frank-yifei-wang/firestore_operations_with_python) summarizes common operations of Firestore using Python.
